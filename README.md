# Digital-Twin-Framework-for-Industrial-Asset-Prognostics
This project is a Digital Twin–based predictive maintenance system that uses sensor data and machine learning to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial equipment. By forecasting failures before they occur, the system enables proactive maintenance scheduling, reducing downtime, costs, and operational risks.
